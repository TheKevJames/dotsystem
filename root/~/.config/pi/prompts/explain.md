description: Explain code or concept clearly, from simple to detailed
---
Explain the following code or concept. Structure your explanation as:

1. **One-liner** — What it does in one sentence
2. **How it works** — Step-by-step walkthrough
3. **Why** — Design decisions and trade-offs
4. **Edge cases** — What could go wrong

Adjust depth to the complexity. Use analogies when helpful.
