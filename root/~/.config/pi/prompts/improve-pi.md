description: Suggest improvements to my pi-coding-agent config

Analyze ~/.config/pi/sessions. Find any cases where you took unnecessary steps or I needed to step in to steer you which might benefit from creating skills, changing your agent prompt, building new extensions, etc, and suggest those changes to me here. Do not make the changes yourself.
