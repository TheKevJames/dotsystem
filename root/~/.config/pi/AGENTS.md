# Project Guidelines

## Code Style
- Follow existing project conventions
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions under 50 lines
- Add comments for complex logic only

## Git
- Conventional Commits: feat/fix/refactor/docs/test/chore
- Atomic commits, one concern per commit
- Never force push to main or master

## Safety
- Never hardcode secrets or API keys
- Always validate user input
- Handle errors explicitly, no silent failures

## Workflow
- Read before write — understand context first
- Minimal changes — don't refactor unrelated code
- Verify after changes — run tests or check output
