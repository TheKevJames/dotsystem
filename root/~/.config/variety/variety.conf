# Move to Favorites is only shown when the user has write permissions over the file, otherwise we fallback to Copy

# clock_filter = <an ImageMagick filter, read below>
#
# The filter defines the ImageMagick command that Variety uses to render the clock on the wallpaper.
# First some scaling is applied to get the image down to the screen size - this ensures
# the final drawn clock won't be rescaled by the desktop wallpaper system.
# Easiest way to see what's happening is to run variety with -v, enable clock and see what ImageMagick
# commands Variety dumps in the log.
#
# The user may want to customize the following aspects:
# fill - color of "filling"
# stroke - color of outline
# strokewidth - width of outline
# gravity - in which corner to display the clock - SouthEast, NorthEast, SouthWest, NorthWest
# annotate - these must be in the form 0x0+[%HOFFSET+X]+[%VOFFSET+Y], where you can edit X and Y -
# distance from the screen corner defined by gravity. Write them in even if they are 0.
#
# The %HOFFSET and %VOFFSET parameters are there for Variety to replace in order to compensate for the
# diferent dimensions of every image and screen.
# The several %FONT parameters are there for Variety to replace with the font settings from the GUI.
#
# The texts can contain these symbols:
#
# %H - hours (24), %I - hours (12), %p - am or pm, %M - minutes,
# %A - day of week (full), %a - day of week abbreviation, %B - month name, %b - month abbreviation, %d - day of month, %Y - year.
# The full list for these can be seen here: http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior
# Have in mind that Variety will not update the clock more often than once every minute, so using seconds (%S) for example is pointless
#
# A tutorial on "annotating" with ImageMagick that you may use as a reference: http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/annotating/
# You can get a very uniquely looking clock with some of the more advanced techniques (e.g. circle-shaped text, interesting colors and shading, etc....).
